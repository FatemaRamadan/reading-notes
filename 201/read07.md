##chapter 3
creating an object 
constructor notaion:
- the `new` keyword and the object constructor creat a blank object.
- after that we can add proparities and methods.
-first we creat an object using a combination of of the `new` keyword and the object()constoctor function.
-we can add proparites and methods usng dot notation.
- each statment that add a property ot method should end with a semicolon.
  
- To update the value of proparties use dot notation or square breackets .
- they work on objects created using letral or constroctor notaion.
- to delet proparty use the `delete` word.

- object constroctor can use a function as a templete for creating objects.
- we have to creat a template with the object proparites and methods.
- each statment that creates a new proparty or method ends with a semicolon .
- the name of a constractor function usually begins with a capital letter
- the upper case used to help the devloper remember to use the new keyword when they creat an object using the function.
- the `this` i used insted of the boject name .
- you creat *instances* of the object using the constroctor function.
- the `new `keyword followed by a call to the function creates a new object.
- th prparities of each object are given as arguments of the function.

### a function gloable scop
- when a function is created at the top level of a script then in its in the **Globale Scope**
- **Globale Variable** all globale variables becom proparites of the window object.
- Variables and arrays:
  * varibales has just one key and one value , variables names are seprated from thier value by equal sighn.
  * Array can store multiple values each piece of information is seprated by a comma,the order of the values is important , values in arrays are put in square bracets separted by commas.
### Arrays are objects they hold a related set of key/value pairs, but the key for each value is the index.
- we can creat arrays and objects to creat complex data structure.
- arrays can store a series of objects 
- objects can hold arrays.

### Built in Objects.
-Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the
  browser window and the current web page shown in that window. 
-These built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages.
- the toolkit has three compartment:
  1. Browser object module, it creates a model of the browser tab or window ,the object `window` represents current broweser , its child obj. reprsent other browser feature.
  2. Documnet object module, it creates a model of the current webpage.`document`object is represented the page as whole.its child object represent other items on the page.
  3.Global java script module.

- Whenever you have a value that is a string, you can use the properties
   and methods of the String object on that value.
-Each character in a string is automatically given a number, called an index
  number. Index numbers always start at zero and not one (just like for
  items in an array).
### Globale Objects: Number objects 
- Whenever you have a value that is a number, you can use the methods and properties of the
   Number object on it. 

METHOD|DESCRIPTION
------|-----------
i sNaN ()|Checks if the value is not a number
toFi xed()|Rounds to specified number of decimal places (returns a string)
toPreci si on()|Rounds to total number of places (returns a string)
toExponenti a1 ()|Returns a string representing the number in exponential notation

- COMMONLY USED TERMS:
  • An integer is a whole number (not a fraction).
  • A real number is a number that can contain a fractional part.
  • A floating point number is a real number that uses decimals to represent a fraction. The term floating point
    refers to the decimal point.
  • Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers that are too big or too small to be conveniently written in
    decimal form. For example: 3,750,000,000 can be represented as 3.75 x109 or 3.75e+12
-Math objects :
PROPERTY DESCRIPTION|METHOD DESCRIPTION
--------------------|------------------
Math.PI|Returns pi (approximately 3.14159265359)
Math. round()|Rounds number to the nearest integer


- Creating an Instance of the data object :
- to creat a data object we use the `Data()` object constructor.
METHOD |DESCRIPTION
-------|-----------
getDate() setDate()|Returns I sets the day of the month (1-31
getDay ()|Returns the day of the week (0-6)
getFul 1Year()|Returns I sets the year (4 digits)


## Chapter 6 :Tables
- a table represents information in a grid format.
- Grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes.
- Each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell. In HTML a table is written out row by row.
- `<table>` element is used to creat a table.
- `<tr>` to indicate the start of each row .
- `<td>` each cell of the table is represented using `<td>` .
- `<th>` it represent heading for either a column or a row.
- `<colospan>` ometimes you may need the entries in a table to stretch across more than one column.
   The colspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across
- `<rowspan>` to indicate how many rows a cell
   should span down the table.
-`<thead>`The headings of the table should sit inside the `<thead>` element.
- `<tbody>`The body should sit inside the `<tbody>` element.
- `<tfoot>`The footer belongs inside the `<tfoot>` element.
- **width attribute** indicates how wide that table should be .



## Article : Domain Moduleing
- Domain modeling :is the process of creating a conceptual model in cod e for specific problem. 

- it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams. 

- object -oriented modle: is an entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods.
- - - - - - - -
Model epic fails videos :
 -you have to build a self-contained objects with the same attributes
  and behaviors so when you need to change the algorithm for determining popularity, the changes will be small and targeted.
- - - - - - - -
- Define a constructor and initialize properties  
- We use a constructor function to define the same properties between many objects.
-Generate Random umbers : 
   *You will need the help of a random number generator to model the random nature of user behaviour. 
Methods can be added to a constructor function's prototype.  

-calculate daily likes 
 *Popularity of a video is measured in Likes. 

- viewers times percentage: the formula for calculating Likes is the number of viewers times the percentage of viewers who'll Like a video 

- To calculate the number of viewers per day:
  *generate a random number between 10 and 30 and then multiply it by the epic rating of that video.

Summary 

-Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem. 

-Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models. 

• When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors. 

• Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties. 

• Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well. 

• Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function. 

• Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside. 

• Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
