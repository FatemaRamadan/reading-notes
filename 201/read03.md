## there are 3 diffrent types of lists 
1. orderd list; where each item in the list in numbered.
  -`<ol>` its created using this tag 
  - each element satrts with `<li>`
2. Unorderd list; lists that begin with a bullet point.
  - `<ul>` its created using this tag .
  -`<li>` each item start and ends with this tag. 
3. Definition lists; made up of a set of terms a long wtih the definishion of each term.
  - `<dl>` its created using this tag.
  - `<dt>`is used to contain the term being defind 
  - `<dd>` is used to contain the definition.
## nested lists  
 - we can put a second list inside an `<li>` element.

## Boxes.
- box dimensions (width,hight).
- to spacify the size of a box we use pixels,precentage or ems.
- when we use the size of the box is based on the size of the text within.
- limiting width;in order to fit user screen, min-width , max-width
- limiting hight ; `min-hight` and `max-width`.
- 'Overflow' content tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box.
- `hidden` it hides any extra content that doesnt fit in the box
- `scroll` this adds a scorllbar to box so that useres scroll to see the missing content.
## border Margin and padding 
- evry box has 3 avalible properies that we can adjust to control the apperrance:
  1. border 
  2. margin
  3. Padding
- border width The border-width property is used to control the width of a border.
 The value of thisproperty can either be givenin pixels or using one of the following values:
     * thin
     * medium
     * thick
- border style; it can be either solid,dashed.dotted or double.groove ridge ; inset ,outse,hidden/none.
- border color; border top/buttom/left/right color .
- the `border` he border property allows you to specify the width, style and color of a border in one property
(and the values should be coded in that specific order).\

## padding 
- The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the
content of an element and its border.
  * padding-top
  * padding-right
  * padding-bottom
  * padding-left
## margin
- The margin property controls the gap between boxes. Its value
is commonly given in pixels, although you may also use percentages or ems.
- center text using `text-align`.
- change display using `inline/block /inline block` or noun.
- visibility of the box `hidden/ visible`
- image border The border-image property applies an image to the border of any box. It takes a background
   image and slices it into nine pieces. the proparity needs 3 information:
  1. the Url 
  2. where to slice the image
  3. what to do with the straight edges.(streatch , repeat,round).
- The box-shadow property allows you to add a drop shadow around a box.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

## Arrays
- arrays are special kind of variables that store list of values>
- we use it when we use a list of values that are related to each other.
- when creating an array we dont need to spacify how many values it hold.
- values in arrray are separated by commas.
- we creat an array like a variable, its values are held between square bracts [].
-array constructor. This uses the new keyword followed by Array();
  The values are then specified in parentheses (not square brackets), and each value is separated by a comma.
- values in arrays are accessed as ifs a numbered list starrting from 0 .
  * Each item in an array isautomatically given a number called an index.
  * To retrieve item on the list, the array name is specified along with the index number in square brackets.
  * Each array has a property called length, which holds the number of items in the array.


# HTML& JAVASCRIPT
- If.. else statment.

![if else ](201/read03.jpg)

- one set of the condition is true the other is false.

# Switch Statment 
- A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the 
code that should run if the variable matches that value.

## TYPE COERCION & WEAK TYPING
- (type Coercion):JavaScript can convert data types to complet operation.
- weak typing is when you can change the data type of a value.
- strong typing , you cant change the data type of a variable.\
- Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript can be treated as if it were true or false; and
   this has some interesting side effects.
- the presence of an object or array is considered truthy it is often used to check for existance of an element.
-the strict equality operators `===and !== `result
  in fewer unexpected values than `==and != `do.

## short circuit values
- Logical operators are processed left to right. They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a
  result - but they return the value that stopped the processing (not necessarily true or fa 1se).

## loops
![loops](201/read00003.jpg)
- loops check condition if it return true, a code block will run.
- then condition is tested again, and it will keep runing untle result is false.
- we have *For loop* a *Whhile loop* and *Do while* 
- loop counters :
 * first intialization of variable
 * Second cheack Condition
 * Update.
- 3 main keys when dealing with loops
 1. keywords such as **break** and **Continue**
 2. Loops and Array; loops are very helpful when dealing with array.
 3. performance issues .
