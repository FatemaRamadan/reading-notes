# THe ABC of programming 

1. what is a script and how do i creat one?
   - script is a series of insturctiond that computer has to follow to achive goal.
   - a browser may use diffrent parts of the script depending on how the user intracts with the webpage.
   - a script can run diffrent sections of codes depending the situation.
   - to write a script first you have to:
      * state your goal.
      * list tasks that you need to complet.
         * Define the goal
         * design the script (split the Goal into series of tasks)
         * code each step.


 ## designing a script:
 - after dividing tasks we can use **flow chart** .
 - each task may be divided into a **Sequance of steps**.
 - these steps then can be divided into **lines of code**.
## from steps to * Code *
 - every line in tasks needed to be written in a language the computer can understand.
 - we need to think like a computer because the achive things diffrently than humans.
 - Designing the Goal and the script:
   * detail your goal to the script (what you want to achive).
   * break tasks into aseries of orders to be performed.
## skitching the tasks in a flow chart.
 - arrows shows how the script moves from one task to another.

2. How do computers fit in the world around them?
  - Computer creates models of the world using data.
  - programmers creat modules for computers using data
##  Objects and proparites 
  - objects has :
   * proparites 
   * events 
   * methods
  - Proparites (charchtarstics) has:
   * name 
   * Value 
  - Events : how the user intract with computer
  - Methods : how people intract with objects.it contains instructions that represent one task.

  ## web browsers are programmes built using objects.
   - window object it represent an HTML page 
    * how browser sees a web page :
       1. retrive a page as HTML code 
       2. creat a module of the page and store it in the memory 
       3. us a renerd engine to show the page on the screen.
    * all major browesers use Java scripts to interprate the instructions to computer can follow.
   - document object 

3. how do i write a script for a web page?
  - HTML is the content layer 
  - CSS is a representaion layer
  - J.s is behivoral layer
- crating a javascript :
 * creat a folder with the exctension of .js
 * link it to html page using `<script>` element .
 * place the script into the page 
 * java script run whenever its found in html.
